# Write a method or function that removes all instances of the letter <strong>s</strong> in a string. The method or function should accept a string as an argument and return the same string with every instance of the letter <strong>s</strong> removed.

# In my words:
# Take a string and write a method that will accept the string as an input and return that same string without any of the "s" characters in it

# Pseudocode:
# 1. Create a variable and assign a string value to it.
# 2. Create a custom method with one parameter that will take a string argument.
# 3. Inside the method, call the .delete method on the string argument from the custom method. The .delete method takes one parameter, and I will enter the argument "s".
# 4. Call the custom method on the variable that contains the string value.
