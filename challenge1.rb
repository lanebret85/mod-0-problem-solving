# Given an array of strings, print only the strings that have exactly 4 characters.

# In my words:
# Write a program that takes an array of elements of type string and print those elements that have exactly 4 characters, no more, no less.

# Pseudocode:
# 1. Create an array that holds some number of elements of type string
# 2. Call the .each method on the array that uses a conditional to print each string element only if that element has exactly 4 characters
